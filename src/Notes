What will we validate while testing a api -

When testing APIs, there are several key aspects to validate:

Response Status Codes: Ensure the API returns the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error).

Response Body: Validate the content of the response body. Check for the expected data structure (JSON or XML) and the presence of required fields.

Response Time: Measure how long it takes for the API to respond and ensure it meets performance requirements.

Headers: Check that the response headers are correct (e.g., content type, authentication tokens, caching headers).

Error Handling: Test how the API handles invalid inputs, ensuring appropriate error messages and status codes are returned.

Authentication and Authorization: Validate that secure endpoints require the correct authentication and that users have the right permissions for the resources they are trying to access.

Data Integrity: Check that the data being sent to and from the API is accurate and consistent with what is expected.

Rate Limiting: Ensure the API properly enforces rate limits and handles requests accordingly.

Security: Validate that the API is protected against common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

Versioning: If applicable, ensure that different API versions function as intended and that backward compatibility is maintained.

By systematically validating these aspects, testers can ensure that APIs are robust, reliable, and meet user requirements.

Status

"Rest Assured" is a popular Java library used for testing RESTful web services. It simplifies the process of writing tests for APIs by
providing a fluent syntax for making HTTP requests and validating responses. With Rest Assured, you can easily send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
requests, and assert various aspects of the response, such as status codes, response body content, headers, and more. It integrates well with
testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG, making it a favored choice for developers and testers working with APIs.

Design Patterns

Creation type design pattern - singleton, factory design pattern = help to create objects

Structural types design pattern - like page object model which help us to structure page objects , also builder pattern

Behaviour design pattern - like an example on language how we want to structure
